About:
Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns.

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
5 chicken drumsticks (about 1 3/4 pounds)
5 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds)
1 large yellow onion, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick
8 cloves garlic, smashed
5 bay leaves
¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 cup cane vinegar (see Tips) or unseasoned rice vinegar
⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce

Instructions:
Step 1
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer. Add drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add thighs to the pot and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks.

Step 2
Add onion, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.

Step 3
Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce.

Food Origins:
Filipino or Spanish? Adobo‘s Disputed Origins
The word adobo is derived from the Spanish word adobar, which means “marinade” or “pickling sauce.” The existence of the tangy dish was first recorded in 1613 by the Spaniard Pedro de San Buenaventura. In the dictionary he was compiling, Buenaventura listed the tart viand as “adobo de los naturales” for its similarity to Spanish and Mexican dishes that went by the same name. But while our favorite ulam’s moniker boasts of a pure Spanish lineage, little else about our adobo can and should be attributed to the Philippines' Hispanic conquerors. According to the food historian Raymond Sokolov, the ingredients for adobo already existed in the Philippines before Ferdinand Magellan even laid eyes on Philippine shores. Because the dish’s original name was never recorded, the Spanish label stuck.
