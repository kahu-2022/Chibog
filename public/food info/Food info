About:
Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns.

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
5 chicken drumsticks (about 1 3/4 pounds)
5 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1 3/4 pounds)
1 large yellow onion, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick
8 cloves garlic, smashed
5 bay leaves
¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1 cup cane vinegar (see Tips) or unseasoned rice vinegar
⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce

Instructions:
Step 1
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer. Add drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add thighs to the pot and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks.

Step 2
Add onion, garlic, bay leaves and peppercorns to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.

Step 3
Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve the chicken with the sauce.

Food Origins:
Filipino or Spanish? Adobo‘s Disputed Origins
The word adobo is derived from the Spanish word adobar, which means “marinade” or “pickling sauce.” The existence of the tangy dish was first recorded in 1613 by the Spaniard Pedro de San Buenaventura. In the dictionary he was compiling, Buenaventura listed the tart viand as “adobo de los naturales” for its similarity to Spanish and Mexican dishes that went by the same name. But while our favorite ulam’s moniker boasts of a pure Spanish lineage, little else about our adobo can and should be attributed to the Philippines' Hispanic conquerors. According to the food historian Raymond Sokolov, the ingredients for adobo already existed in the Philippines before Ferdinand Magellan even laid eyes on Philippine shores. Because the dish’s original name was never recorded, the Spanish label stuck.

Recipe Name: Balut
Image: food.image.4
Category: Weird food
About:
Balut is a street food widely consumed in the Philippines, but is also popular in places like Vietnam, where it's called hot vit lon, Thailand, China, Malaysia and other southeast Asian countries. There's no creative way to describe balut, but to just tell it like it is — it's a fertilized duck egg. Yes, it's a duck egg that has been incubated at about 104 degrees fahrenheit for a specific period of time. The fertilization process for balut ranges from 16-20 days. So, that means inside this fertilized duck egg is an embryo that is about a week short of hatching. If you can stomach it enough to picture it, this far in the development process the embryo will have feathers and a beak.

There you have it. Balut, a delicacy that has been a staple in the Filipino culture for more than 200 years, is an unhatched baby duck. 

If you can't stomach balut, there's always the option to try the unfertilized duck egg (which is widely known as Penoy.)

Ingredients:
1 fertilized duck egg.
Salt.
Instructions:
(It's probably too traumatising to describe it here, so we'll let you Google it yourselves)

Food Origins:
Despite the popular association of the consumption of fertilized duck eggs or incubated eggs to the Filipino cuisine, it has been documented to have existed and in many Asian countries. It has been identified that fertilized duck egg consumption was originally developed in China.

During the sixteenth century, the practice of making incubated eggs was believed to be brought by Chinese traders to the Philippines when they settled along the shorelines of Laguna de Bay. At that time, a particular town near the area has an abundance of Mallard ducks raised mainly for its eggs. In general, ducks are known to adapt in almost all kinds of environmental conditions and varying feeding practices and have immunity to common bird diseases. This municipality initiated and popularized the process of making incubated eggs which is now famously known as “balut.”
